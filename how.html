<h3> Github Repository </h3>
<p>I'm using Github Repository for source code of this contact form.<br /><a href="https://github.com/sirkapil/contact">github.com/sirkapil/contact</a><br />
This is link to Github Repository , you can clone it or fork it ! Any suitable changes through pull requests are welcome.</p>
<section>
<h3> Netlify </h3>
<p> I'm using netlify to host my form , it deploy instanly any commit made to github repository. the data you submit in contact form is saved to my netlify account and they inform me about any form submission through mail along with a copy of your message.
</p>
<div class="epigraph">
<blockquote>
<p>As Github Pages serves static sites and has limited features so you don't have inbuilt contact form option there. Therefore, you have to rely on third party for contact form submission , but most of them sell/exchange private information of users submitted through contact form , even  google form uses private information for advertising. that's why , Netlify was my choice to store contact form data.</p>
