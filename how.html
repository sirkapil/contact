<h3> Github Repository </h3>
<p>I'm using Github Repository for source code of this contact form.<br /><a href="https://github.com/sirkapil/contact">github.com/sirkapil/contact</a><br />
This is link to Github Repository , you can clone it or fork it ! Any suitable changes through pull requests are welcome.</p>
<section>
<h3> Netlify </h3>
<p> I'm using netlify to host my form , it deploy instanly any commit made to github repository. the data you submit in contact form is saved to my netlify account and they inform me about any form submission through mail along with a copy of your message.
</p>
<div class="epigraph">
<blockquote>
<p>As Github Pages serves static sites and has limited features so you don't have inbuilt contact form option there. Therefore, you have to rely on third party for contact form submission , but most of them sell/exchange private information of users submitted through contact form , even  google form uses private information for advertising. that's why , Netlify was my choice to store contact form data.</p>

<h3> Erlen's Codepen </h3>
<p>Major of source code is taken from Erlen's Codepen. <br />
<a href="//erlen.co.uk" target="_blank">Erlen's HomePage</a>   <a href="#" target=_blank">Erlen's Codepen</a><br /> I have made most of changes in  <i>contact.js, contact.css </i> and a few changes in<i> index.html </i>file. Mostly changes are to make it compatible with <i>tufte css.</i></p>

<h3> Tufte CSS </h3>
<p>Tufte CSS is inspired from Edward Tufte’s books and handouts.it was created by Dave Liepmann .<br />This is github repository of <i>tufte css.</i><br/><a href="https://googleweblight.com/i?u=https://github.com/edwardtufte/tufte-css/" target="_blank">github.com/edwardtufte/tufte-css</a></p>
<div class="epigraph">

<p>I like tufte css and implemented it in many blog posts. The best thing , I love about tufte css is it's compatibility with side notes and marginal notes. Typography is really cool and looks amazing with any mathematical equation. its background is clean and eye friendly , moreover looks like content is written on any sheet of paper. Another thing that I love about tufte css is that it is printer friendly and looks great in PDF or printed format. </p>
